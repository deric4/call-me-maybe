## Why you might be interested

Lots of people talk about the importance of tests, but its not always easy to implement them in your own code.

I've found that most developers _(anyone that has to use a texteditor as part of their job junction)_ were not introduced to the world of development through the lens of needing to test or maintain code that serves any sort of business function.

A very popular repository on GitHub (over 100k :star:s!) is [@kamranahmedse's developer-roadmap](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap).  

How far down the map do you have to go before you get to *testing*? Is this reflective of your learning experience?

_note: I've linked the 'Backend' roadmap, but other roadmaps have a similar journey_

<!-- Increase in Enterprise organization focusing on automation of tests -->
Digital Transformation -> means more work for developers

Many companies are currently or planning initiatives to adopt current industry practices, not because they want to use the "new & shiny" but because there's business value provided by adapting technologies and workflows which reduce delivery time.

...but they still want the "new & shiny" i.e. _Continous_ or _Automated_ ...

Frequently this can make even the most minor of changes to an existing code base feeling like...

There's a reason why no one's touched that code in _insert unit of time_

### Types of Testing

You'll hear following words thrown around quite a bit when talking about testing... and they can mean very different things depending on the context they're used. 

* unit
* functional
* integration
* end-to-end
* perfomance
* regression
* ...
* ...
* ...
* ...
* ...

For example, a unit test might mean something slightly different between developers who use live in different ecosystems (Python vs Java). What about between Data Scientists, SysAdmins, or Network Engineers.

It can feel a little bit like Calvinball at times.

Figuring out what is you need to test.

<!-- TEST ALL THE THINGS -->
* This may vary depending on what you're working:
  - jupyter notebook
  - web application
  - cli tool
  - serverless function
  - library/package
* Code Structure
* Scope
